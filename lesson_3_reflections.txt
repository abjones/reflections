When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    Remote repositories are great for group projects where you want to track in the 
    same location and all work is done remotely. Further, a remote repository provides
    some additional security for hard drive faults, backing it up "in the cloud" vice
    to your local workstation.

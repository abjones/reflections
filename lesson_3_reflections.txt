When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    Remote repositories are great for group projects where you want to track in the 
    same location and all work is done remotely. Further, a remote repository provides
    some additional security for hard drive faults, backing it up "in the cloud" vice
    to your local workstation. 
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

		The remote repository has other users interacting with it. The changes
		they make may not play nice with the new functionality that I am 
		locally developing. Rather than deal with all of the changes now as a 
		mini merge, I'd rather they stay present on the online repository until
		I am either ready to commit and push my changes or commit and pull from
		the repository to ensure compatibility.
